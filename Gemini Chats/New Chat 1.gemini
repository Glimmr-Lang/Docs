[{"text":"I'm writing a new programming language called glimmr. It is a functional programming language that is closely similar to haskell when it comes to schematics but the syntax resembles mainstream languages: e.g; fn main : Unit = println(\"Hello, world\"). Your goal is to  write the introduction to the docs site. ","user":true},{"text":"# Welcome to Glimmr: Functional Programming, Simplified\n\nGlimmr is a new functional programming language designed to bring the elegance and power of Haskell to a wider audience.  Inspired by Haskell's strong type system, immutability, and emphasis on pure functions, Glimmr offers a familiar syntax, making it approachable for programmers coming from languages like C++, Java, Python, or JavaScript.\n\nTired of wrestling with complex syntax and cryptic error messages?  Glimmr provides a clean, readable syntax that prioritizes clarity and expressiveness. You'll find yourself writing concise, maintainable code without sacrificing performance.\n\n**What makes Glimmr unique?**\n\n* **Familiar Syntax:** Glimmr adopts a syntax that's intuitive and easy to learn for programmers accustomed to mainstream languages.  No more grappling with unusual symbols or esoteric notation.\n\n* **Powerful Type System:**  Glimmr boasts a robust type system that catches errors at compile time, leading to more reliable and robust applications.  This strong typing, inherited from Haskell, helps prevent runtime surprises and enhances code clarity.\n\n* **Pure Functional Paradigm:** Embrace the benefits of immutability and pure functions.  Glimmr encourages a declarative programming style, making your code easier to reason about, test, and parallelize.\n\n* **Modern Features:** Glimmr incorporates modern functional programming features such as higher-order functions, currying, pattern matching, and algebraic data types, enabling you to write expressive and efficient code.\n\n* **Interoperability:**  (Future plans, depending on development) We aim for seamless interoperability with other languages and existing systems.\n\n\n**Who is Glimmr for?**\n\nGlimmr is perfect for:\n\n* **Experienced programmers:**  Looking for a more elegant and expressive way to write code.\n* **Students:** Learning functional programming concepts in a less intimidating environment.\n* **Developers:** Seeking a language that promotes code maintainability and reduces bugs.\n* **Anyone:** Interested in exploring the power of functional programming with a less steep learning curve.\n\n\n**Get Started:**\n\nDive in and explore the documentation to learn more about Glimmr's features, syntax, and standard library.  Start building amazing applications today!  Let's `glimmr` into the future of functional programming!\n","user":false}]
