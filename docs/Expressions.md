# Expressions

An expression is a combination of literals, operators, and variables that evaluates to a value. Expressions are used to perform calculations, comparisons, and assignments in a program.

## Examples of Expressions

From `literals`, we know that literals are values that are written exactly as they are meant to be interpreted. Here are some examples of expressions that use literals:

## Arithmetic expressions:

+ `2 + 3` evaluates to 5

+ `5 - 2` evaluates to 3

+ `4 * 5` evaluates to 20

## String expressions:


+ `"hello" + " world"` evaluates to "hello world"


From `operators`, we know that operators are symbols used to perform operations on values. Here are some examples of expressions that use operators:
  

## Comparison expressions:

  
+ `5 > 3`  evaluates to true

+ `2 == 3`  evaluates to false

+ `"hello" != "goodbye" `  evaluates to true

## Logical expressions:

  
+ `true && false`  evaluates to false

+ `true || false`  evaluates to true

+ `!true`  evaluates to false

## Assignment expressions:

  
+ `let  x = 5` assigns the value 5 to the variable x

+ `let x += 2` increments the value of x by 2

  

## Let Declarations
  

Let declarations are used to declare and initialize variables. Here are some examples:


- `let x = 5;`  declares a variable x and initializes it with the value 5

- `let name = "John";`  declares a variable name and initializes it with the string "John"

- `let isAdmin = true;`  declares a variable isAdmin and initializes it with the boolean value true
  

From `firstprogram`,  we can see an example of a simple program that uses expressions

and let declaration to calculate the area of a rectangle.

  

```
// calculate the area of a rectangle

let width = 5;

let height = 3;

let area = width * height;

```



In this example, the expression `width * height` evaluates to the product of the values of `width` and `height`, which is then assigned to the variable `area`.
