>> Glimmr is a new functional programming language designed to bring the elegance and power of functional programming to a wider audience.  Inspired by Ocaml's strong type system, Haskell's immutability, and emphasis on pure functions, Glimmr offers a familiar syntax, making it approachable for programmers coming from other languages.

## What makes Glimmr unique
- Familiar Syntax -  Glimmr adopts a syntax that's intuitive and easy to learn for programmers accustomed to mainstream languages. 
- Powerful Type System:  Glimmr boasts a robust type system that catches errors at compile time, leading to more reliable and robust applications.
- Pure Functional Paradigm: Glimmr encourages a declarative programming style, making your code easier to reason about, test, and parallelize. 
- Modern Features: Glimmr incorporates modern functional programming features such as higher-order functions, currying, pattern matching, and algebraic data types, enabling you to write expressive and efficient code.
- Interoperability:  We aim for seamless interoperability with JavaScript

## Who is Glimmr for?
>> Glimmr is perfect for:  **Experienced programmers** , **Students** Learning functional programming and **Anyone** Interested in exploring the power of functional programming with a less steep learning curve.
